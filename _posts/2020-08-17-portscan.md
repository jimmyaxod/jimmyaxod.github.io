# Port scanner

This evening I thought I'd jump into golang. As a first project, why not a simple portscanner?
I also wrote a java portscanner for comparison and benchmarking.
The results were ok, the Java version is a little faster, but as a port scanner isn't particularly CPU intensive, it was more a measure of whether
go can do things properly.
As I'm only just starting out with go, I don't know if there's any way to speed up the go version anymore, or whether it's as fast as it can be.
For the Java version, a speedup would be to have 1 thread per CPU, which would spread the (fairly low) CPU load and might give some performance increase.

## In go (Average execution time 1638ms)

```
/* Simple start to go programming
 *
 */
package main

import (
    "net"
    "os"
    "sync"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

/*
 * Simple port scanner in go. One of my first go programs!
 *
 * Usage is <host>
 *
 * eg portscan.go google.com
 */
func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    timeout := 500 * time.Millisecond

    target := os.Args[1]

    starttime := time.Now().UnixNano()

    for port := 1; port < 65536; port++ {
        where := fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", target, port)

        wg.Add(1)
        go func(ww string) {
            defer wg.Done()
		        conn, err := net.DialTimeout("tcp", ww, timeout)
		        if err == nil {
	        	    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "OPEN %s\n", where)

			          conn.Close();
		        } else {
//	        	  fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "ERROR %s\n", err.Error())			
		        }
	      }(where)
    }

    fmt.Println("Waiting for everything to finish...")
    wg.Wait()
    
    endtime := time.Now().UnixNano()
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "Took %dms\n", (endtime - starttime) / 1e6)
    os.Exit(0)
}
```

Note that obviously, you need to make sure you can open 65535 file handles at the os level. With this approach, we quickly go through 65535 ports, creating a new go func to do a net.DialTimeout connect call. Either it succeeds or fails. To ensure we wait for our goroutines, we use a WaitGroup.

## In Java (Average execution time 1407ms)

```
import java.net.*;
import java.nio.*;
import java.nio.channels.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Portscan {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		// port scan the target...
		String target = args[0];
		System.out.println("Scanning " + target);

		long starttime = System.currentTimeMillis();

		Selector selector = Selector.open();

		// Now put in everything we want to try to connect to...
		for(int port=1;port<65536;port++) {
			addConnection(selector, new InetSocketAddress(target, port));
		}

		int total = selector.keys().size();
		int done = 0;

		// Wait for all of them to complete...
		long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
		
		while(true) {
			long timeLeft = 500 - (System.currentTimeMillis() - now);
			if (timeLeft <= 0) break;

			int n = selector.select(timeLeft);

			Set t = selector.selectedKeys();
			Iterator i = t.iterator();
			while(i.hasNext()) {
				SelectionKey selk = (SelectionKey) i.next();
        SocketChannel ssc = (SocketChannel) selk.channel();
				i.remove();

				if (selk.isValid()) {
					if (selk.isConnectable()) {
						try {
							ssc.finishConnect();
							System.out.println("OPEN " + ssc);
						} catch(Exception e) {}
						done++;
					}
				}
				selk.cancel();
      }

			if (done==total) break;
		}

		long endtime = System.currentTimeMillis();
		System.out.println("Took " + (endtime - starttime) + "ms");
	}
	
	public static void addConnection(Selector selector, InetSocketAddress target) throws Exception {
		SocketChannel sc = SocketChannel.open();
		sc.configureBlocking(false);
		sc.socket().setSoTimeout(500);
		SelectionKey sk = sc.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT);
		if (sc.connect(target)) {
			System.out.println("OPEN " + sc);
			sk.cancel();
		}
	}
}

```

The Java version is a bit more complex in terms of code, but more straightforward when it comes to what's actually going on, and in what order.

* Go:	real: 1.756s  user: 3.431s  sys: 1.588s
* Java:   real: 1.633s  user: 0.671s  sys: 0.686s

Couple of things to note here. Firstly, the Java version is single threaded, whereas the Go version is using multiple cores. Also the Go version is using almost 3x the sys CPU time as Java, and around 5x the user CPU time.

# libp2p-noise

Got a little further with the libp2p noise encryption. It's a shame that having just completed a working implementation of secio, it's being deprecated! Oh well, onwards and upwards.
The IPFS crawler is working well, collecting lots of interesting information and metrics about the network.
