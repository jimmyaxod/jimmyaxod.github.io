# Port scanner

This evening I thought I'd jump into golang. As a first project, why not a simple portscanner?
I also wrote a java portscanner for comparison and benchmarking.
The results were ok, the Java version is a little faster, but as a port scanner isn't particularly CPU intensive, it was more a measure of whether
go can do things properly.

# libp2p-noise

Got a little further with the libp2p noise encryption. It's a shame that having just completed a working implementation of secio, it's being deprecated! Oh well, onwards and upwards.
The IPFS crawler is working well, collecting lots of interesting information and metrics about the network.
