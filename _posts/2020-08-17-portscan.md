# Port scanner

This evening I thought I'd jump into golang. As a first project, why not a simple portscanner?
I also wrote a java portscanner for comparison and benchmarking.
The results were ok, the Java version is a little faster, but as a port scanner isn't particularly CPU intensive, it was more a measure of whether
go can do things properly.
As I'm only just starting out with go, I don't know if there's any way to speed up the go version anymore, or whether it's as fast as it can be.
For the Java version, I made a multithreaded optimization which starts up 4 threads (I'm on a 4 core machine). Can't think of any other speedups at the moment.

It's worth noting that the Go version uses a fair bit of CPU, both user and sys, as well as actually having a longer average execution time than both java versions.


## Timings

| Version             |  real |  user |   sys | open ports | Code time |
| ------------------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---------- | --------- |
| Go                  | 1.569 | 2.857 | 1.620 |          3 |     1.318 |
|                     | 1.414 | 3.061 | 1.452 |          2 |     1.392 |
|                     | 1.338 | 2.964 | 1.478 |          2 |     1.506 |
| Java single thread  | 1.540 | 1.180 | 0.862 |          2 |     1.382 |
|                     | 1.529 | 1.351 | 0.784 |          2 |     1.352 |
|                     | 1.430 | 1.235 | 0.866 |          2 |     1.430 |
| Java 4 threads      | 1.144 | 2.381 | 1.178 |          3 |     1.046 |
|                     | 1.222 | 2.289 | 1.432 |          3 |     1.113 |
|                     | 1.141 | 2.183 | 1.242 |          3 |     1.048 |

As you can see, best performance is from the 'Java 4 threads' version (Testing was on a 4 core laptop).
Note that as a timeout of 500ms was used, sometimes an open port was not detected if it didn't respond within that time.

Note that obviously, you need to make sure you can open 65535 file handles at the os level. With this approach, we quickly go through 65535 ports, creating a new go func to do a net.DialTimeout connect call. Either it succeeds or fails. To ensure we wait for our goroutines, we use a WaitGroup.
With the single threaded Java version we just use NIO to request connection attempts.
And finally with the multithreaded java version we spin up 4 threads to do a range of ports each, and wait until they're all complete.

## In go

```
/* Simple start to go programming
 *
 */
package main

import (
    "net"
    "os"
    "sync"
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

/*
 * Simple port scanner in go. One of my first go programs!
 *
 * Usage is <host>
 *
 * eg portscan.go google.com
 */
func main() {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup

    timeout := 500 * time.Millisecond

    target := os.Args[1]

    starttime := time.Now().UnixNano()

    for port := 1; port < 65536; port++ {
        where := fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", target, port)

        wg.Add(1)
        go func(ww string) {
            defer wg.Done()
		        conn, err := net.DialTimeout("tcp", ww, timeout)
		        if err == nil {
	        	    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "OPEN %s\n", where)

			          conn.Close();
		        } else {
//	        	  fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "ERROR %s\n", err.Error())			
		        }
	      }(where)
    }

    fmt.Println("Waiting for everything to finish...")
    wg.Wait()
    
    endtime := time.Now().UnixNano()
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "Took %dms\n", (endtime - starttime) / 1e6)
    os.Exit(0)
}
```

## In Java single thread

```
import java.net.*;
import java.nio.*;
import java.nio.channels.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Portscan {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
		// port scan the target...
		String target = args[0];
		System.out.println("Scanning " + target);

		long starttime = System.currentTimeMillis();

		Selector selector = Selector.open();

		// Now put in everything we want to try to connect to...
		for(int port=1;port<65536;port++) {
			addConnection(selector, new InetSocketAddress(target, port));
		}

		int total = selector.keys().size();
		int done = 0;

		// Wait for all of them to complete...
		long now = System.currentTimeMillis();
		
		while(true) {
			long timeLeft = 500 - (System.currentTimeMillis() - now);
			if (timeLeft <= 0) break;

			int n = selector.select(timeLeft);

			Set t = selector.selectedKeys();
			Iterator i = t.iterator();
			while(i.hasNext()) {
				SelectionKey selk = (SelectionKey) i.next();
        SocketChannel ssc = (SocketChannel) selk.channel();
				i.remove();

				if (selk.isValid()) {
					if (selk.isConnectable()) {
						try {
							ssc.finishConnect();
							System.out.println("OPEN " + ssc);
						} catch(Exception e) {}
						done++;
					}
				}
				selk.cancel();
      }

			if (done==total) break;
		}

		long endtime = System.currentTimeMillis();
		System.out.println("Took " + (endtime - starttime) + "ms");
	}
	
	public static void addConnection(Selector selector, InetSocketAddress target) throws Exception {
		SocketChannel sc = SocketChannel.open();
		sc.configureBlocking(false);
		sc.socket().setSoTimeout(500);
		SelectionKey sk = sc.register(selector, SelectionKey.OP_CONNECT);
		if (sc.connect(target)) {
			System.out.println("OPEN " + sc);
			sk.cancel();
		}
	}
}

```

## Java multithreaded (4 core)

The Java version is a bit more complex in terms of code, but more straightforward when it comes to what's actually going on, and in what order.

# libp2p-noise

Got a little further with the libp2p noise encryption. It's a shame that having just completed a working implementation of secio, it's being deprecated! Oh well, onwards and upwards.
The IPFS crawler is working well, collecting lots of interesting information and metrics about the network.
