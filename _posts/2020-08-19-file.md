Today I think I'm going to write some basic file processing in go and java...

Here's the situation.

Given a directory full of files, we want to read them in line by line. Then we want to output them to a set of files based on some sharding.
So for example, we could create 256 output files, 00-ff and output lines based on the hash of the line (Or some part of the line).

This provides a lot of opportunity for paralelism, and includes potentially blocking operations (Disk IO). So it'll be interesting to see how the approaches
and benchmarks differ.
